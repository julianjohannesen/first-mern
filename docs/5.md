# Step 5 - Adding routes to React

Next, we're going to jump back into our React front-end to add a couple of routes to App.js. Don’t worry if you don’t know much about React or client-side routing. We’re not going to dwell on React. We need just enough code at this point to navigate to a couple of different pages.

First, we’ll install the browser version of a popular routing library called React Router.

```
 npm i react-router-dom
```

Now, open src/App.js.

One of the first things you may notice is that React uses JavaScript’s native module API. That means that modules are imported like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
```

And exported like this:

```js
export default App;
```

We’re making a note of it here, because we were just looking at a different way to import and export modules in Node.js that used Node’s require() method.

Delete everything in App.js and copy and paste in the following code.

```js
// App.js

import React from 'react';

// Import the methods that we need from 'react-router-dom'
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link} from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
   return (
    <Router>
        <div className="App">
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/login">Log In</Link>
            <Switch>
                <Route exact path="/">
                    <Home />
                </Route>
                <Route exact path="/login">
                    <LogIn />
                </Route>
            </Switch>
        </div>
    </Router>
   );
}

function Home() {
   return <h2>You're on the Homepage!</h2>;
}

function LogIn() {
   return <h2>You're on the LogIn Page!</h2>;
}

export default App;
```

So, we’ve added routing to a Home page and a Log In page. The components that will render when a user visits those pages are the Home and LogIn components respectively. Those components are defined just below App. Now we need to double check that the front-end of our app is still functioning. Refresh your browser and use the new nav links to visit the Home page and the Log In page. The URL in the address bar and text on the page should change.
